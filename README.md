# Secure-Website-Using-Cryptography
(Use of Caesar cipher , encryption and decryption technique)
Our project focuses on
building a secure website using Python and the Caesar cipher cryptography technique. By implementing the Caesar
cipher, we ensure data confidentiality and integrity for our websiteâ€™s communications. This project aims to demonstrate
the effectiveness of basic cryptographic methods in safeguarding sensitive information exchanged over the web.
